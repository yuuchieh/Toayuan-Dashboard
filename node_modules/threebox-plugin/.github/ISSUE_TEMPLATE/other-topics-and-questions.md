Hello! Thanks for contributing.

As a general rule, if a question does not show any minimum effort in explaining the problem, we might close the issue here and instead recommend asking on Stack Overflow.

Most of the common "how do I...?" questions can be resolved reading the [documentation](https://github.com/jscastro76/threebox/blob/master/docs/Threebox.md), or reviewing the available [examples](https://github.com/jscastro76/threebox/blob/master/examples/README.md).   

If you cannot find your answer there, please read some good practices about [How to ask a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask#:~:text=%20How%20do%20I%20ask%20a%20good%20question?,of%20your%20question,%20start%20by%20expanding...%20More) and provide a Minimal Reproducible Example on [fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), [codepen](https://codepen.io/) or any other code sandbox.  

You have also the option to ask at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/threebox), where the issues with **[threebox]** tag are reviewed periodically.
